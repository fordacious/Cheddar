Cheddar
=======

HTML 5 game framework. Written to allow easy porting of flash games to HTML 5 and the creation of new games in HTML 5. Will document soon, for now, there is a couple of examples
Works fine with coffeescript too.

Cheddar is made up of a bunch of files in the js/Cheddar folder but I usually compile it to js/Cheddar.js.
Still need to separate jQuery from there.
